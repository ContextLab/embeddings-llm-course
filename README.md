## Overview

**"You shall know a word by the company it keeps."** - J.R. Firth, 1957

In this assignment, you will embark on a deep exploration of how machines represent meaning. Working with 250,000 Wikipedia articles, you will implement and compare methods spanning five decades of computational linguistics and natural language processing - from classical statistical techniques to modern large language models.

This assignment asks fundamental questions: What does it mean to "understand" the meaning of a document? How do different computational approaches capture semantic relationships? What aspects of human semantic knowledge can be modeled through distributional representations? Which methods best capture the conceptual structure of human knowledge as encoded in Wikipedia?

You will implement ~10 different embedding methods, perform sophisticated quantitative and qualitative analyses, create beautiful interactive visualizations, and connect your findings to theories of meaning in cognitive science and linguistics. This is a substantial, 2-week assignment that will deepen your understanding of how we represent and compute with meaning.
## Dataset

You can automatically download the dataset from Dropbox if it doesn't already exist in your working directory. The following code will handle downloading the dataset, checking if it's present, and loading it into your notebook:

```python
import os
import urllib.request
import pickle

# Define the file name and URL
dataset_url = 'https://www.dropbox.com/s/v4juxkc5v2rd0xr/wikipedia.pkl?dl=1'
dataset_path = 'wikipedia.pkl'

# Download the dataset if it doesn't exist
if not os.path.exists(dataset_path):
    print("Downloading dataset...")
    urllib.request.urlretrieve(dataset_url, dataset_path)
    print("Download complete.")

# Load the dataset
with open(dataset_path, 'rb') as f:
    wikipedia = pickle.load(f)
```

The dataset is formatted as a `list` of dictionary (`dict`) objects, each with the following keys/values:
- **'title'**: The title of the article (string).
- **'text'**: The full text of the article (string).
- **'id'**: A unique identifier for the article (string).
- **'url'**: The link to the Wikipedia page (string).

There are 250K articles in all, randomly selected from [this dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/legacy-datasets/wikipedia).


## Learning Objectives

## Tips and Best Practices

### Computational Efficiency

**Working with Large Datasets:**
- Start with a subset (e.g., 10K articles) for development
- Once code works, scale to full 250K dataset
- Cache embeddings to avoid recomputation
- Use batch processing for transformer models

**GPU Utilization:**
- Request GPU runtime in Colab (Runtime → Change runtime type)
- Monitor GPU memory usage with `nvidia-smi`
- Use mixed precision (fp16) for large models
- Clear cache between models: `torch.cuda.empty_cache()`

**Time Management:**
- Budget ~30 minutes per embedding method for full dataset
- Topic models (BERTopic, Top2Vec) are slowest (1-2 hours)
- Clustering is fast (<5 minutes for most methods)
- Visualization can be slow for 250K points; consider downsampling

### Implementation Tips

**Handling Long Documents:**
- Transformers have max length (512 for BERT, 1024 for GPT-2)
- Strategies:
  - Truncate to first N tokens (simple but loses information)
  - Sliding window with averaging (more complete but slower)
  - Hierarchical: split document, embed chunks, aggregate
  - Use models with longer context (Longformer, BigBird)

**Aggregating Word Vectors:**
- Simple mean: `np.mean(word_vectors, axis=0)`
- TF-IDF weighted: weight by term importance
- Max pooling: `np.max(word_vectors, axis=0)`
- Try multiple strategies and compare

**Choosing Hyperparameters:**
- For clustering: use elbow method, silhouette scores
- For UMAP: `n_neighbors=15`, `min_dist=0.1` are good defaults
- For t-SNE: `perplexity=30-50` for large datasets
- Document your choices and justify them

### Analysis Tips

**Statistical Rigor:**
- Don't just report one number - use confidence intervals
- Compare methods with statistical tests (paired t-test, Wilcoxon)
- Use bootstrap resampling for uncertainty estimates
- Consider multiple random initializations for clustering

**Visualization Best Practices:**
- Use colorblind-friendly palettes (viridis, plasma, colorbrewer)
- Label axes and include legends
- Make plots large enough to read
- Interactive > static for exploratory analysis
- Include captions explaining what to look for

**Qualitative Analysis:**
- Look at actual examples, not just metrics
- Sample from best AND worst clusters
- Find interesting edge cases
- Use LLMs to help interpret, but verify their interpretations

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**Don't:**
- Forget to normalize embeddings before clustering (for cosine similarity)
- Use too many clusters (overfitting) or too few (underfitting)
- Trust metrics blindly - always inspect examples
- Cherry-pick results that fit expectations
- Plagiarize or use GenAI output without understanding

**Do:**
- Start simple, then add complexity
- Validate assumptions with examples
- Compare multiple approaches

## Expected Timeline

This is a 2-week intensive assignment (Weeks 3-4 of the course). With GenAI assistance and focused implementation, here's a suggested timeline:

### Week 1: Implementation of All Methods, Initial Clustering
- Set up environment, download dataset
- Implement all classical methods (LSA, LDA)
- Implement all static embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText)
- Implement contextualized embeddings (BERT, GPT-2)
- Implement modern embeddings (Sentence-BERT, Llama)
- Implement topic models (BERTopic, Top2Vec)
- Generate embeddings for full dataset
- Apply clustering algorithms (K-Means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN/HDBSCAN)
- Compute initial quantitative metrics

### Week 2: Analysis, Visualization, Cognitive Science Connection, and Extensions
- Perform qualitative analysis and error analysis
- Cross-method comparison and interpretation
- Create multi-level clustering hierarchies
- Create interactive Plotly visualizations (3D scatter, 2D hexbin, cluster comparisons)
- Implement dimensionality reduction (t-SNE and UMAP)
- Write cognitive science connection and theoretical analysis
- Implement advanced extension (Option A, B, or C)
- Polish all outputs and finalize documentation

**Total estimated effort: 25-35 hours** (with GenAI assistance for coding and documentation)

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I really need to implement all 10+ methods?**
A: Yes. The comparison is the core of the assignment. However, if you have significant technical difficulties with one method, document the issue and move on.

**Q: Can I use a smaller subset of the data?**
A: For development, yes. For final submission, use the full 250K articles (or justify why you used fewer).

**Q: How do I handle out-of-memory errors?**
A: Use batch processing, reduce batch size, use smaller models, or process in chunks. Ask for help if stuck.

**Q: Can I use different Wikipedia data?**
A: Prefer the provided dataset for comparability, but you can use different data if you have a good reason (must justify).

**Q: How much analysis is enough?**
A: Quality > quantity. Deep analysis of a few interesting findings beats superficial treatment of many.

**Q: Can I work with a partner?**
A: Check course policy. Generally, collaboration is allowed but each person must submit their own work.

**Q: How important are the visualizations?**
A: Very important. They're worth 15 points and central to understanding the results. Invest time here.

**Q: What if my results are "bad" (low metrics, unclear clusters)?**
A: Document what you found! Negative results are still results. Analyze why and what it means.

**Q: Can I use commercial APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic)?**
A: Prefer open-source models, but if you have credits, you can use APIs for comparison.

## Final Words

This assignment is designed to be challenging, extensive, and deeply educational. It's not meant to be completed in a weekend. Take your time, explore the methods, think deeply about the results, and enjoy the process of discovering how machines represent meaning.

The goal isn't just to get high metrics or pretty plots - it's to develop a sophisticated understanding of how different computational approaches capture semantic information, and to think critically about what these methods reveal (and obscure) about language and meaning.

Don't hesitate to be creative, try additional ideas, and follow interesting threads you discover. The best projects will show intellectual curiosity, rigorous analysis, and genuine insight.

**Good luck, and enjoy exploring the semantic space!**
